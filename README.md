For subscriptions we need to add web sockets to our application.
Subscriptions are real time event notification.
Web socket is a fully duplex connection that is persistent (for the duration of the session), not stateless as an http request.
Usefull for real time apps, chats, etc.
Insomnia does not allow us to create socket connections, only Banana Cake Pop does that, so use it for testing!
